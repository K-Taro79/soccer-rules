# RoboCupJunior Soccer rules

Welcome to the [RoboCupJunior Soccer](https://junior.robocup.org/) rules
repository for the 2020 season.

For this season the RoboCupJunior Soccer Technical Committee (TC) would like to
invite the RoboCupJunior Soccer community to suggest any changes that would be
worth making to the rules. Note that the Technical Committee will in the end
approve or disapprove any suggested changes for the 2020 rules, but every
suggested change (that is found to be reasonable by the TC) will be looked at,
examined and considered.

## What changes are you looking for?

*TBD*

Changes that would improve formatting of the rules or their clarity are most
definitely welcome.

We accept proposals until the **24th of May, 2019**.

## How do I suggest a change?

Please edit the [`tex/rules.tex`](tex/rules.tex) file. The easiest way of doing
that seems to be following the
[GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)
on how to edit files in another user's repository.

In the end that should
result in a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

When suggesting a change, please follow the following rules:

1. Small Pull Requests are better than big ones.
2. Please only include one 'change type' (i.e. grammar/structure/gameplay ...)
   in one Pull Request
3. Please make sure to fill in the [Pull Request
   template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

## That's way too complicated!

We do realize it may look like that. If you do not feel comfortable with
suggesting a change using the process above, feel free to open a [GitHub
issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) by filling a form
[here](https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/soccer-rules/issues/new). We can
discuss your suggestion there, and if it makes sense someone will certainly
put it into the actual `rules.tex` document.
