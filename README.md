# RoboCupJunior Soccer rules

Welcome to the RoboCupJunior Soccer rules repository for the 2018 season.

For this season the RoboCupJunior Soccer Technical Committee (TC) would like to
invite the RoboCupJunior Soccer community to suggest any changes that would be
worth making to the rules. Note that the Technical Committee will in the end
approve or disapprove any suggested changes for the 2018 rules, but every
suggested change (that is found to be reasonable by the TC) will be looked at,
examined and considered.

## What sort of a change are you looking for?

Since the last year's rules changed quite dramatically, the changes for this
year will most probably be on smaller scale and more game-related. The overall
goal of the TC is to change the rules so that they make the game more
interesting (for both competitors and spectators) while also keeping it
challenging from the technical point of view.

## How do I suggest a change?

Please edit the [tex/rules.tex](tex/rules.tex) file while following the
[GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)
on how to edit files in another user's repository. In the end that should
result in a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
